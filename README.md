# Unity-Sanja
Scripts for the Unity game made for my girlfriend's birthday. These are just the scripts so there are no prefabs, assets 
and all the other necessary files for the game. If you are really interested to see, please e-mail me and I can share parts
of it with you (not all because some parts are personal).

Note: Names of the scripts and variable names are mostly in Croatian.
